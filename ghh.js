As with any generalization, not all things are black and white, which is why we also have the concept of Grey Hat hackers. 
Grey Hat hackers land somewhere in the middle between “good” and “bad.” They are the people who look for vulnerabilities in a system without permission but with potentially good intentions.
They might inform an organization that they have been able to exploit their system and subsequently ask for a fee to fix it.
However, if the organization does not respond in a timely manner or if they do not comply at all, this Grey Hat hacker may become a Black Hat hacker 
by posting the point of exploitation on the internet for all the world to see or even exploiting the vulnerability themselves.
Technically, the work of a Grey Hat hacker is illegal no matter their intentions since they did not have permission to try and break into a system
